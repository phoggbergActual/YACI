# YACI — Yet Another Check-In

> **YACI** is the tool. **Yaky** is the behavior.

YACI is a lightweight, cross-platform check-in tool for developers who want structured versioning, audit logging, and disciplined release tracking — without the bloat of CI pipelines or the chaos of freeform Git usage.

## 📐 Design Philosophy

> “Make the right way easy, and the wrong way hard.”

Yaky was designed to support individual and team developers who range from loose creatives to strict policy followers. It enables consistent versioning and auditing while minimizing disruption to flow.

## 🔧 Features
- Auto-increment or manual version control
- Timestamped, user-tagged Git commits
- Updates `Version:` and `Commit Tag:` lines in source
- Git commit and tag in one step
- Cross-platform (Bash, PowerShell, CMD)
